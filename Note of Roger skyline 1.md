# Virtual Machine Installation <a id="VMinstall"></a>

I choose [Google Cloud Platform(GCP)](http://console.cloud.google.com) for this project since it is free. You can apply for GCP service if you have google accout and bank credit card. Google provides you Promotional Credits which values $300 and one year trial period.

**Reminderï¼š** Don't forget to cancel the subscriton before promotional credits using up or trial period ending, otherwise you will receive a real bill.
